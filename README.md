# 🏋🏼 Workit 💪🏽
Workit is a fun app that uses full CRUD operations. <br/>
This simple app was created by yours truly, for the final Full-Stack-Project for Per-Scholas.<br/>
I have gone thru many changes In my project but I still have a lot off additions I would like to add. See further down for more details.<br/>

## Workit is an exercise tracker for individuals who would like to track their time being active.

Individuals who sign up for the tracker will be able to do the following:<br/>
> 1.Create a user<br/>
> 2.Log measurements<br/>
> 3.Get a calculation of bmi<br/>
> 4.See how much weight that needs to be lost or gained<br/>
> 5.Log an exercise

<br/> It also features a bmi calculation for those who want to see where they are currently.<br/> Workit also provides how much weight you should lose or gain based on your measurements.<br/>
