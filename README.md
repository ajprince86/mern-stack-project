# üèãüèº Workit üí™üèΩ
Workit is a fun app that uses full CRUD operations. <br/>
This simple app was created by yours truly, for the final Full-Stack-Project for Per-Scholas.<br/>
I have gone thru many changes In my project but I still have a lot off additions I would like to add. See further down for more details.<br/>

## Workit is an exercise tracker for individuals who would like to track their time being active.

Individuals who sign up for the tracker will be able to do the following:<br/>

> 1. Create a user<br/>
> 2. Log measurements<br/>
> 3. Get a calculation of bmi<br/>
> 4. See how much weight that needs to be lost or gained<br/>
> 5. Log an exercise<br/>
> 6. Edit user <br/>
> 7. Delete user <br/>
> 8. See all logged exercises
